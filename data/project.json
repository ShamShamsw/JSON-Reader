Sprint 4 Retrospective & Sprint 5 Planning: Redis Integration\n\nSprint 4 focused on establishing the foundational data storage layer for the project using Redis and **Amazon ElastiCache**. Key accomplishments include:\n\n- **Engine Selection:** The team finalized the decision to utilize **Redis** as the primary data store, recognizing its flexibility and ease of integration compared to alternatives (**Valkey**).\n- **Deployment Strategies:** We successfully explored and implemented two distinct Redis deployment approaches: a self-managed Redis instance on an EC2 and a managed Redis service via Amazon ElastiCache. This provided valuable insights into the nuances of each method, including setup, connectivity, and management.\n- **Connectivity & Security:** We successfully connected to both Redis deployments from EC2 instances, implementing basic security group configurations to control network access. We also initiated the process of securing connection credentials by exploring the integration of AWS Secrets Manager.\n- **Driver Integration:** We identified and began integrating the necessary Redis client libraries (e.g., `redis-py` in Python) to enable interaction with the database from our application code.\n- **Connection Pooling (Initial):** For the EC2-based Redis setup, initial steps towards implementing connection pooling were taken to optimize resource utilization and application performance.\n\nThis is our groundwork for data management within the application. The knowledge and infrastructure established with Redis will be leveraged in subsequent sprints as we build out application logic and workflows.\n\n## Sprint 5 Preview: Infrastructure and Workflow Automation\n\nMoving into Sprint 5, the focus will shift towards building out the core infrastructure and automating key deployment and operational aspects of the project. The planned objectives include:\n\n1. **Network Infrastructure (NAT Gateways):** Ensuring secure outbound internet access for resources in private subnets.\n2. **Network Security (Security Groups & NACLs):** Implementing granular network access control at both the instance and subnet levels.\n3. **Workflow Automation (Step Functions):** Designing and implementing automated workflows to orchestrate various application tasks, potentially involving Lambda functions.\n4. **Scalability & Resilience (Auto Scaling):** Configuring auto-scaling capabilities for compute resources (Lambdas and potentially EC2/ECS) to ensure application availability and handle varying loads.\n5. **Data Security (KMS Keys):** Implementing encryption at rest using customer-managed KMS keys to protect sensitive data.\n6. **Access Control (IAM Roles & Policies):** Defining and implementing least-privilege IAM roles and policies for various AWS resources to ensure secure access and permissions.\n7. **Credential Management (Secrets Manager):** Fully integrating AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage database credentials and other sensitive information, building upon the initial exploration in Sprint 4.\n8. **VPC Architecture (VPC and Subnet Strategy):** Defining the complete Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture, including CIDR ranges, public/private subnet layout across Availability Zones, and documenting this design.\n\nThe work completed with Redis in Sprint 4, particularly regarding connectivity and credential management, will directly inform the configuration of security groups, NACLs, IAM roles, and the full integration with Secrets Manager planned for Sprint 5. The ability to connect to and interact with our chosen data store is a prerequisite for building the application workflows that will be orchestrated using Step Functions.","id":"6815a83dd435c71326e1f457","name":"Review of Sprint 4 and plans for sprint 5","idShort":107,"shortLink":"zsGWVQFr"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment

In Python, using`redis-py`. This library provides the necessary functions and classes to establish connections, send commands to the Redis server, and handle responses. Our application code would import this library to perform operations like setting, getting, and managing data within Redis.\n- Using Redis from an EC2 instance, in a production environment (**DEVOPS/CICD)**, efficient resource management is crucial. Connection pooling is a technique that maintains a set of open and reusable connections to the Redis server, rather than establishing a new connection for each operation. This significantly reduces the overhead associated with connection establishment and tear-down, leading to improved application performance and reduced latency. The `redis-py` library, for example, provides built-in connection pooling capabilities that can be configured to manage a pool of connections to the Redis server running on the EC2 instance or the ElastiCache cluster. Our application would be configured to use this connection pool, ensuring efficient and scalable interaction with Redis.\n\n  Summary:\n\n  The project integrates a Redis library in Python for interaction, implements connection pooling on the EC2 instances to optimize performance.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"67f42991d986ecc8c09ce5de","name":"Implement Database Connection Logic in Lambdas","idShort":31,"shortLink":"1MnubRMo"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment Project","shortLink":"ewFqM3ri"},"list":{"id":"67f4258da2904eb696716cbf","name":"Sprint 4"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"commentCard","date":"2025-05-03T05:14:34.555Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":900,"warnAt":720},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":14}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/67cf41054df51ea848ca63df/07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","fullName":"Jacob haseman","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Jacob haseman","initials":"JH","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"jacobhaseman1"}},{"id":"6815a57da108078a04c929c1","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","data":{"old":{"dueComplete":false},"card":{"dueComplete":true,"dateCompleted":"2025-05-03T05:11:25.873Z","id":"67f4298c7207e992fee6398e","name":"Provision RDS Cluster (Multi-AZ)","idShort":28,"shortLink":"dPV8EJ5v"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment Project","shortLink":"ewFqM3ri"},"list":{"id":"67f4258da2904eb696716cbf","name":"Sprint 4"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2025-05-03T05:11:25.890Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/67cf41054df51ea848ca63df/07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","fullName":"Jacob haseman","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Jacob haseman","initials":"JH","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"jacobhaseman1"}},{"id":"6815a57a4c2369ef290dd182","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","data":{"idCard":"67f4298c7207e992fee6398e","text":"Project objectives include selecting Redis as the Relational Database Service (RDS) engine, configuring the appropriate instance size and storage capacity, and establishing the necessary network and subnet group configurations.

summary:\n\nOur team selected Redis and Amazon ElastiCache as the preferred data storage solutions for this product, determining that Valkey presented a higher degree of complexity in terms of setup time and resource allocation. Redis offered multiple straightforward methods for connection and data management. The team explored two distinct approaches to establishing Redis connectivity: the first involved deploying Redis on an EC2 instance connected to a GitHub repository, mirroring a classroom setup. The second method utilized the Amazon ElastiCache endpoint, connecting a separate EC2 instance and executing a local Python test file. While both approaches presented unique advantages and disadvantages, the team prioritized flexibility and gaining practical experience with primary nodes through these diverse implementation strategies.

First, an EC2 instance must be provisioned. Due to associated costs, it is recommended that this instance be terminated upon completion of the task. Screenshots detailing the EC2 creation process are available. Subsequently, a Python file containing the desired code needs to be created on the instance. An initial example of such a Python file is provided, with the intention of incorporating customer order functionality at a later stage.\n\n\nEC2 Creation

of Changes:**\n\n- `ioredis` **Import:** We import the `ioredis` library.\n- `redisClient` **Variable:** A variable to hold the Redis client instance. This helps reuse the connection across Lambda invocations within the same execution context.\n- `connectRedis` **Function:** This asynchronous function handles establishing the connection to Valkey. It checks if a client already exists and creates a new one if not. It also includes basic error handling for the connection.\n- **Environment Variable Usage:** The `VALKEY_HOST` and `VALKEY_PORT` environment variables are used to configure the Redis client.\n- **Cache Key Generation:** We create simple cache keys based on the data being cached (e.g., `order:${email}`, `product:info`, `inventory:Robo Assistant X`). In a real application, you might need more sophisticated key generation strategies.\n- **Cache Retrieval (**`redis.get`**):** Before fetching from the primary data source, the code attempts to retrieve data from the Valkey cache using the generated key.\n- **Cache Hit:** If the data is found in the cache (`cachedOrder` or `cachedProductInfo` is not null), it's returned directly, improving performance.\n- **Cache Miss:** If the data is not in the cache, the function proceeds to fetch it from the \"primary source\" (currently mocked data in your example).\n- **Cache Storage (**`redis.setex`**):** After fetching from the primary source, the data is stored in the Valkey cache with an expiration time (`ex` in seconds). This ensures that the cached data doesn't become stale indefinitely.\n- **Error Handling:** Basic `try...catch` blocks are added around the Redis operations to handle potential errors during cache interaction. It's important to decide how you want your application to behave if the cache is temporarily unavailable (e.g., always fall back to the primary source).\n- **Cache Invalidation (in** `ModifyOrder`**):** A commented-out example shows how you might invalidate cache entries when data is modified.\n\n**Remember to:**\n\n1. **Install the** `ioredis` **library** in your Lambda environment.\n2. **Set the** `VALKEY_HOST` **and** `VALKEY_PORT` **environment variables** for each Lambda function.\n3. **Deploy these updated Lambda functions.**\n\nAfter deployment, your Lambda functions will attempt to read from the Valkey cache first and fall back to the original logic if the data isn't cached or if there's an error connecting to Valkey. Subsequent requests for the same data within the cache expiration time should be significantly faster.","textData":{"emoji":{}},"card":{"id":"680d9a3d2b11bb03a5fcfa70","name":"Lambda Function

Caches: [https://valkey.io/](https://valkey.io/ \"smartCard-inline\")\n\nValkey is a fork of open-source Redis. While largely API-compatible with Redis, Valkey guarantees its open nature, which some developers prefer for long-term stability and freedom. Additionally, newer Valkey versions have introduced performance enhancements, particularly in multithreading, potentially offering better resource utilization in some workloads compared to older open-source Redis. For users concerned about recent licensing changes in Redis, Valkey provides a reliable and performant open-source option with strong backing from major cloud providers.\n\n**Summary of Your Valkey Cache Creation:**\n\nUsing AWS ElastiCache's serverless deployment option \"order-cache-valkey.\". The serverless option, will **automatically manage** the underlying **infrastructure** and scaling of your Valkey cache. This means you won't need to **manually provision** or **configure individual nodes** or **scaling policies**. The **cache will dynamically adjust its capacity based on the traffic and data** storage needs of your **serverless website order site**. You've also opted to create a new, empty cache, ready to store data.\n\n![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/680d924a7e2c0d495f8160c6/attachments/680d96b06acbe7325a0eb2fc/download/image.png)","id":"680d924a7e2c0d495f8160c6","name":"Database","idShort":101,"shortLink":"DmuRpqs7"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment

API Summary\n\nHere's a summary of the API interactions implemented in the current code:\n\n1. **Create Order:** `POST /orders`\n   - The HTML form with the ID `order-form` sends data to this endpoint.\n   - The form collects customer ID, product IDs, quantities, and total order amount.\n   - The JavaScript code constructs a JSON payload from the form data and sends it to the `/orders` endpoint using the `fetch` API.\n   - On success, the user is shown an alert with the new order ID, and the form is reset.\n   - On failure, an error message from the server is displayed to the user.\n2. **Get Inventory:** `GET /get-inventory`\n   - The `fetchInventory()` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - This function is triggered when the \"View Inventory\" button is clicked.\n   - The response from the API (expected to be inventory data in JSON format) is displayed in the `inventory-details` element within a popup.\n   - Error handling is included to display user-friendly messages for network errors or server-side issues.\n3. **Get Product Info:** `GET /get-product-info?productId={productId}`\n   - The `fetchProductInfo(productId)` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - The function is triggered when the \"Get Product Info\" button is clicked, and it takes the product ID from the input field.\n   - The response from the API (expected to be product information in JSON format) is displayed in the `product-details` element within a popup.\n   - Error handling is included to display informative messages.\n4. **Get Order Details:** `GET /get-order?orderId={orderId}`\n   - The `fetchOrder(orderId)` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - The function is triggered when the \"Check Order\" button is clicked, and it takes the order ID from the input field.\n   - The response from the API (expected to be order details in JSON format) is displayed in the `order-details` element within a popup.\n   - Error handling is included.\n5. **Modify Order:** `PUT /orders/{orderId}`\n   - The `modifyOrder(orderId, orderData)` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - The function is triggered when the \"Update Order\" button is clicked (Note: You'll need to create this button and the associated input fields in your HTML). It takes the order ID and the updated order data as parameters.\n   - The `orderData` includes the `customerId`, `items` (array of product IDs and quantities), and `total`.\n   - The API expects the `orderId` in the URL path and the updated order data in the request body (JSON format).\n   - On success, the updated order details are displayed.\n   - On failure, an error message is displayed.","id":"680b26c750265da5795e6f75","name":"API Summary","idShort":98,"shortLink":"S48oCyYY"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment

wanted to take a moment to recap the progress made so far to provide a clear understanding of where we're starting from as we enter Sprint 3.\n\nOur primary objective from Week 1 has been to create a static website (hosted on S3) with a functional form that allows users to place and submit orders. These orders will then be sent to an API Gateway, which will trigger the appropriate Lambda functions. If time permits, integrating a database will be the next logical step in future phases.\n\nDuring Sprint 2, we successfully created the S3 bucket and enabled static website hosting through the bucket properties. Moving into Sprint 3, the focus will be on finalizing and integrating the Lambda functions: `CreateOrder`, `GetOrder`, `GetInventory`, `GetProductInfo`, and `ModifyOrder`, all developed using JavaScript. However, before these functions can be utilized, setting up the API Gateway is a critical prerequisite—and this forms the core objective of Sprint 3.","id":"680aafcfaf5e4e4d5912ab8a","name":"Review of

from utilizing resources from canvas and the syllabus to define scope.\n\n‌\n\n### Sprint 2 to Sprint 3 Progression Summary\n\nThis document outlines the transition from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3, with a focus on enhancing backend infrastructure, implementing security measures, and initiating structured API development in alignment with scalable, cloud-native architecture principles.\n\n---\n\n### Work Completed in Sprint 2\n\nSprint 2 concluded with several foundational components in place, including:\n\n- A fully operational continuous delivery pipeline encompassing build automation, testing frameworks, and manual approval gates.\n- Configured EC2 instances with appropriate IAM roles and security permissions for development and deployment purposes.\n- An updated project backlog and reference architecture reflecting all completed tasks and system design decisions.\n- Integration of initial application components such as a sample `app.js` file for deployment testing and validation of pipeline flow.\n\n---\n\n### Objectives for Sprint 3\n\nSprint 3 marks a significant advancement in the service delivery architecture. The focus will shift to establishing robust API management, enhancing system security, and preparing for long-term data and endpoint governance.\n\n1. **API Gateway with Custom Domain Configuration**\n   - Set up AWS API Gateway to manage HTTP requests and route them efficiently to the appropriate backend services.\n   - Associate the API Gateway with a custom domain name to ensure brand consistency and enhance external accessibility.\n2. **Implementation of AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n   - Define and enforce WAF rules to mitigate common web exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and request flooding.\n   - Configure the firewall at the edge level to provide global protection and reduce load on application resources.\n3. **Development of CRUD API Endpoints (Excluding Delete)**\n   - Begin implementing RESTful API endpoints to support Create, Read, and Update operations for user-submitted data and system entities.\n   - Exclude Delete functionality at this stage to prevent data loss during early iterations and retain historical records for auditing.\n4. **Endpoint Identification and Definition**\n   - Conduct a detailed analysis to define the full scope of required API endpoints.\n   - Document method types, data models, expected responses, and security considerations for each endpoint to ensure consistent API behavior and support maintainability.\n5. **Persistent Storage of User Requests**\n   - Initiate the design and implementation of persistent storage for capturing user-generated data and request logs.\n   - Select an appropriate managed storage solution (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB or Aurora) and establish a schema that supports indexing, querying, and data integrity.","id":"68032dbdaed1dd04e73cbdee","name":"Sprint 2 to Sprint 3","idShort":83,"shortLink":"kAhPLQDw"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment Project","shortLink":"ewFqM3ri"},"list":{"id":"67f42589cadc5088bacfd6e9","name":"Sprint 2"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2025-04-19T05:00:38.129Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/67cf41054df51ea848ca63df/07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","fullName":"Jacob haseman","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Jacob haseman","initials":"JH","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"jacobhaseman1"}},{"id":"68032dbdaed1dd04e73cbe0e","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","data":{"card":{"id":"68032dbdaed1dd04e73cbdee","name":"Sprint 2 to Sprint 3","idShort":83,"shortLink":"kAhPLQDw"},"list":{"id":"67f42589cadc5088bacfd6e9","name":"Sprint 2"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment Project","shortLink":"ewFqM3ri"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"createCard","date":"2025-04-19T04:59:41.084Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/67cf41054df51ea848ca63df/07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","fullName":"Jacob haseman","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Jacob haseman","initials":"JH","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"jacobhaseman1"}},{"id":"68032d7a2ef0f6f27a869e5d","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","data":{"old":{"closed":false},"card":{"closed":true,"dateClosed":"2025-04-19T04:58:34.320Z","id":"67f4297e41317ddde091822e","name":"Define Customer Data API Endpoint","idShort":19,"shortLink":"m6EiFThg"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment Project","shortLink":"ewFqM3ri"},"list":{"id":"67f4258b523a83cca834a1b8","name":"Sprint 3"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2025-04-19T04:58:34.333Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/67cf41054df51ea848ca63df/07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","fullName":"Jacob haseman","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Jacob haseman","initials":"JH","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"jacobhaseman1"}},{"id":"68031949b6b917dee7647f48","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","data":{"old":{"dueComplete":false},"card":{"dueComplete":true,"dateCompleted":"2025-04-19T03:32:25.288Z","id":"68031941e4baa1d791dae686","name":"Current Github Summary","idShort":82,"shortLink":"AIk4SyEK"},"board":{"id":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","name":"Assignment Project","shortLink":"ewFqM3ri"},"list":{"id":"67f42589cadc5088bacfd6e9","name":"Sprint 2"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2025-04-19T03:32:25.304Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/67cf41054df51ea848ca63df/07e39513f0aef6f3abba5d4f74c7081a","fullName":"Jacob haseman","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Jacob haseman","initials":"JH","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"jacobhaseman1"}},{"id":"68031946dcb850b3bd95e5f7","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","data":{"old":{"desc":""},"card":{"desc":"### **GitHub Repository Summary**\n\nThis repository serves as the foundation for a web application project with a structured DevOps workflow and modular development.

1️⃣ **Speed for Customers Everywhere (Low Latency)**\n\n- Without CloudFront: Customers far away from your server (e.g., someone in India accessing a server in the U.S.) will see slower load times.\n- With CloudFront: Content is delivered from the **nearest edge location**, reducing wait times and improving user experience.\n\n> **Example:** Product images, scripts, and styles load instantly no matter where the user is.\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ **Security with HTTPS and DDoS Protection**\n\n- CloudFront integrates with **AWS Shield** to protect your site from attacks.\n- It easily supports **SSL/TLS (HTTPS)** to encrypt traffic and keep user data (like orders) secure.\n- You can **block malicious traffic** before it even hits your backend using **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** rules.\n\n> 🛡️ This is especially important when customers are submitting sensitive data (emails, payment info, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ **Caching Static Assets While Protecting Dynamic APIs**\n\n- CloudFront is **great for static content** (HTML, images, JavaScript).\n- For **dynamic content** like API calls (e.g., fetching current inventory or placing orders), CloudFront can be configured to **pass those requests directly to your backend (no caching)**.\n- You can even fine-tune cache behavior using **cache policies** and **origin request policies**.\n\n> ⚙️ This way, **inventory counts and order data stay up-to-date**, while static content loads quickly from cache.\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ **Global Scaling and Reliability**\n\n- CloudFront is designed to **scale automatically** for high traffic.\n- No matter how many customers visit your site, CloudFront helps keep your site available and responsive.\n\n> 🚀 This makes it easier to grow your business without worrying about performance issues.\n\n---\n\n### 5️⃣ **Cost Optimization**\n\n- Since CloudFront caches content, **your origin server (like S3, Lambda, or EC2)** gets fewer requests.\n- This reduces compute, database, and bandwidth costs on your backend.\n\n> 💰 Less traffic to your dynamic services = lower AWS bills.\n>\n> Still can be pricy without free tier

**S3 Bucket Creation (for Hosting or Artifacts) with AWS**\n\n- **Purpose**: Store static site files or build artifacts.\n- **Configuration**:\n  - Enable **static website hosting** (if hosting).\n  - Set `index.html` and `error.html` as default pages.\n  - Optionally enable **public read access** (for static websites).\n  - Use `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` for dev/test buckets to auto-delete.\n\n### **IAM Role Assignment (for CodeBuild Access)**\n\n- **Purpose**: Grant **CodeBuild** permission to access S3, build resources, and deploy.\n- **Steps**:\n  - Create an **IAM Role** for CodeBuild with a **trust policy** for `codebuild.amazonaws.com`.\n  - Attach **managed or inline policies** for:\n    - `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject` (for build artifacts or deployment)\n    - Logging (`logs:*`)\n    - Access to CodeCommit, GitHub, or source repositories\n\n‌\n\n### **CodeBuild Project Configuration + yml file in canva**\n\n- **Purpose**: Automate build, test, and deploy steps.\n- **Steps**:\n  - Define the **build environment** (e.g., `Amazon Linux 2`, Node.js, Python).\n  - Provide a `buildspec.yml` file that defines build commands.\n  - Set the **source location** (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit, or S3).\n  - Set the **artifacts output** (e.g., send to S3 or deploy to hosting bucket).\n  - Attach the previously created **IAM role**.\n\n‌\n\n### **Summary: Hosting a Static Website on S3 with AWS CDK**\n\nThis guide walks you through using **AWS CDK (TypeScript)** to deploy a **static website** to **Amazon S3** using code.\n\n#### 🔧 What It Does:\n\n- Creates an **S3 bucket** configured for static website hosting.\n- Sets **index.html** and **error.html** as default documents.\n- Optionally enables **public read access** to make the site accessible.\n- Automatically uploads your static site files (from a `./site` folder) to the bucket.\n- Outputs the **website URL** after deployment.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"jacobhaseman1+344sqrr28nw81ewsf6n+34co5un40xc3iubbenm+1y1enwo94g@boards.trello.com","externalSource":null,"idBoard":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"67f42589cadc5088bacfd6e9","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"67f4239417e6cdfb6c2e7471","idShort":76,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"S3

**\"Create Order\"**\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ **Create the React OrderForm Component**\n\n- Build a component (`OrderForm.jsx`) using:\n  - `useState` to manage form values (item, quantity, notes)\n  - `handleSubmit` function to manage form submission\n- On submit:\n  - Prevent default form behavior\n  - Construct an order object\n  - Use `axios.post()` to send order to backend\n  - Show success or

The focus will shift to establishing robust API management, enhancing system security, and preparing for long-term data and endpoint governance.\n\n1. **API Gateway with Custom Domain Configuration**\n   - Set up AWS API Gateway to manage HTTP requests and route them efficiently to the appropriate backend services.\n   - Associate the API Gateway with a custom domain name to ensure brand consistency and enhance external accessibility.\n2. **Implementation of AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n   - Define and enforce WAF rules to mitigate common web exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and request flooding.\n   - Configure the firewall at the edge level to provide global protection and reduce load on application resources.\n3. **Development of CRUD API Endpoints (Excluding Delete)**\n   - Begin implementing RESTful API endpoints to support Create, Read, and Update operations for user-submitted data and system entities.\n   - Exclude Delete functionality at this stage to prevent data loss during early iterations and retain historical records for auditing.\n4. **Endpoint Identification and Definition**\n   - Conduct a detailed analysis to define the full scope of required API endpoints.\n   - Document method types, data models, expected responses, and security considerations for each endpoint to ensure consistent API behavior and support maintainability.\n5. **Persistent Storage of User Requests**\n   - Initiate the design and implementation of persistent storage for capturing user-generated data and request logs.\n   - Select an appropriate managed storage solution (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB or Aurora) and establish a schema that supports indexing, querying, and data integrity.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"jacobhaseman1+344sqrr28nw81ewsf6n+34coou0cgqgz2h3per2+0a6541s46d@boards.trello.com","externalSource":null,"idBoard":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"67f42589cadc5088bacfd6e9","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"67f4239417e6cdfb6c2e7471","idShort":83,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Sprint 2 to Sprint 3","nodeId":"ari:cloud:trello::card/workspace/67f4239417e6cdfb6c2e7471/68032dbdaed1dd04e73cbdee","pinned":false,"pos":33023.75,"shortLink":"kAhPLQDw","shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/kAhPLQDw","sourceEmail":null,"staticMapUrl":null,"start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/kAhPLQDw/83-sprint-2-to-sprint-3","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"mirrorSourceId":null,"mirrorSourceNodeId":null,"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"680aafcfaf5e4e4d5912ab8a","address":null,"badges":{"attachments":0,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":true,"lastUpdatedByAi":false,"start":null,"externalSource":null,"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"maliciousAttachments":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false},"checkItemStates":[],"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"creationMethodError":null,"creationMethodLoadingStartedAt":null,"dueComplete":true,"dateClosed":null,"dateLastActivity":"2025-04-25T04:52:10.087Z","dateCompleted":"2025-04-25T04:52:10.081Z","dateViewedByCreator":null,"desc":"I wanted to take a moment to recap the progress made so far to provide a clear understanding of where we're starting from as we enter Sprint 3.\n\nOur primary objective from Week 1 has been to create a static website (hosted on S3) with a functional form that allows users to place and submit orders. These orders will then be sent to an API Gateway, which will trigger the appropriate Lambda functions. If time permits, integrating a database will be the next logical step in future phases.\n\nDuring Sprint 2, we successfully created the S3 bucket and enabled static website hosting through the bucket properties. Moving into Sprint 3, the focus will be on finalizing and integrating the Lambda functions: `CreateOrder`, `GetOrder`, `GetInventory`, `GetProductInfo`, and `ModifyOrder`, all developed using JavaScript. However, before these functions can be utilized, setting up the API Gateway is a critical prerequisite—and this forms the core objective of Sprint 3.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"jacobhaseman1+344sqrr28nw81ewsf6n+34dtqwef96bmwloj4wa+2mvp4ec8kw@boards.trello.com","externalSource":null,"idBoard":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"67f4258b523a83cca834a1b8","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"67f4239417e6cdfb6c2e7471","idShort":84,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Review

API Summary\n\nHere's a summary of the API interactions implemented in the current code:\n\n1. **Create Order:** `POST /orders`\n   - The HTML form with the ID `order-form` sends data to this endpoint.\n   - The form collects customer ID, product IDs, quantities, and total order amount.\n   - The JavaScript code constructs a JSON payload from the form data and sends it to the `/orders` endpoint using the `fetch` API.\n   - On success, the user is shown an alert with the new order ID, and the form is reset.\n   - On failure, an error message from the server is displayed to the user.\n2. **Get Inventory:** `GET /get-inventory`\n   - The `fetchInventory()` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - This function is triggered when the \"View Inventory\" button is clicked.\n   - The response from the API (expected to be inventory data in JSON format) is displayed in the `inventory-details` element within a popup.\n   - Error handling is included to display user-friendly messages for network errors or server-side issues.\n3. **Get Product Info:** `GET /get-product-info?productId={productId}`\n   - The `fetchProductInfo(productId)` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - The function is triggered when the \"Get Product Info\" button is clicked, and it takes the product ID from the input field.\n   - The response from the API (expected to be product information in JSON format) is displayed in the `product-details` element within a popup.\n   - Error handling is included to display informative messages.\n4. **Get Order Details:** `GET /get-order?orderId={orderId}`\n   - The `fetchOrder(orderId)` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - The function is triggered when the \"Check Order\" button is clicked, and it takes the order ID from the input field.\n   - The response from the API (expected to be order details in JSON format) is displayed in the `order-details` element within a popup.\n   - Error handling is included.\n5. **Modify Order:** `PUT /orders/{orderId}`\n   - The `modifyOrder(orderId, orderData)` function sends a request to this endpoint.\n   - The function is triggered when the \"Update Order\"

While largely API-compatible with Redis, Valkey guarantees its open nature, which some developers prefer for long-term stability and freedom. Additionally, newer Valkey versions have introduced performance enhancements, particularly in multithreading, potentially offering better resource utilization in some workloads compared to older open-source Redis. For users concerned about recent licensing changes in Redis, Valkey provides a reliable and performant open-source option with strong backing from major cloud providers.\n\n**Summary of Your Valkey Cache Creation:**\n\nUsing AWS ElastiCache's serverless deployment option \"order-cache-valkey.\". The serverless option, will **automatically manage** the underlying **infrastructure** and scaling of your Valkey cache. This means you won't need to **manually provision** or **configure individual nodes** or **scaling policies**. The **cache will dynamically adjust its capacity based on the traffic and data** storage needs of your **serverless website order site**.

summary:\n\nOur team selected Redis and Amazon ElastiCache as the preferred data storage solutions for this product, determining that Valkey presented a higher degree of complexity in terms of setup time and resource allocation. Redis offered multiple straightforward methods for connection and data management. The team explored two distinct approaches to establishing Redis connectivity: the first involved deploying Redis on an EC2 instance connected to a GitHub repository, mirroring a classroom setup. The second method utilized the Amazon ElastiCache endpoint, connecting a separate EC2 instance and executing a local Python test file. While both approaches presented unique advantages and disadvantages, the team prioritized flexibility and gaining practical experience with primary nodes through these diverse implementation strategies. Supporting documentation, including visuals of the EC2 instances, Elasticache configuration, and security groups, is also available.\n\n‌\n\nPython code Redis Server 1:\n\n\n```\nimport redis\nimport random\nimport faker\nimport json\n\n\n# Replace with your actual EC2 public DNS or IP\nHOST = \"34.219.253.200\"\nPORT = 6379\n\nr = redis.Redis(host=HOST, port=PORT, decode_responses=True)\n\n# Test connection\ntry:\n    pong = r.ping()\n    print(\"Connected to Redis:\", pong)\n\n    # Set and get a key\n    r.set(\"message\", \"Hello from Python\")\n    value = r.get(\"message\")\n    print(\"Stored value:\", value)\n\nexcept redis.ConnectionError as e:\n    print(\"Redis connection error:\", e)\n\n# Initialize Faker for synthetic customer IDs\nfake = faker.Faker()\n\n# Generate and store 10 fake order records\n# for i in range(10):\n#     order_id = f\"order:{i}\"\n#     order_data = {\n#         \"Customer ID\": fake.uuid4(),\n#         \"Product 1 ID\": f\"prod-{random.randint(1000, 9999)}\",\n#         \"Quantity 1\": random.randint(1, 20)\n#     }\n#     r.set(order_id, json.dumps(order_data))\n\n# # Retrieve and print the stored orders\n# for i in range(10):\n#     order_id = f\"order:{i}\"\n#     data = r.get(order_id)\n#     print(f\"{order_id}: {data}\")\n```\n\n‌\n\nExample of output/data sent:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"customerId\": \"12345\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"P001\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"P002\",\n      \"quantity\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 100.50\n}\n```\n\n‌\n\nRedis Security Group\n\n![Redis1.jpg](https://trello.com/1/cards/68159f5b0dbaede979d6c527/attachments/6815a0e40583658c4338fe7b/download/Redis1.jpg)\n\n‌\n\nZones and nodes as well as security group selected:\n\n![Redis2.jpg](https://trello.com/1/cards/68159f5b0dbaede979d6c527/attachments/6815a121108458c905029b70/download/Redis2.jpg)\n\n‌\n\nAdding Redis Security Group to EC2:\n\n![Redis3.jpg](https://trello.com/1/cards/68159f5b0dbaede979d6c527/attachments/6815a162f9332c86373d56bc/download/Redis3.jpg)\n\nAdding Inbound rule SSH to Redis Security group for Redis server 2\n\n![Redis1.jpg](https://trello.com/1/cards/68159f5b0dbaede979d6c527/attachments/6815a0e40583658c4338fe7b/download/Redis1.jpg)\n\n‌\n\nRedis Server 2 example summary:\n\nTo locally create and execute a Python file on an EC2 instance, the following steps are necessary.

Screenshots detailing the EC2 creation process are available. Subsequently, a Python file containing the desired code needs to be created on the instance. An initial example of such a Python file is provided, with the intention of incorporating customer order functionality at a later stage.\n\n\nEC2 Creation

Sprint 4 Retrospective & Sprint 5 Planning: Redis Integration\n\nSprint 4 focused on establishing the foundational data storage layer for the project using Redis and **Amazon ElastiCache**. Key accomplishments include:\n\n- **Engine Selection:** The team finalized the decision to utilize **Redis** as the primary data store, recognizing its flexibility and ease of integration compared to alternatives (**Valkey**).\n- **Deployment Strategies:** We successfully explored and implemented two distinct Redis deployment approaches: a self-managed Redis instance on an EC2 and a managed Redis service via Amazon ElastiCache. This provided valuable insights into the nuances of each method, including setup, connectivity, and management.\n- **Connectivity & Security:** We successfully connected to both Redis deployments from EC2 instances, implementing basic security group configurations to control network access. We also initiated the process of securing connection credentials by exploring the integration of AWS Secrets Manager.\n- **Driver Integration:** We identified and began integrating the necessary Redis client libraries (e.g., `redis-py` in Python) to enable interaction with the database from our application code.\n- **Connection Pooling (Initial):** For the EC2-based Redis setup, initial steps towards implementing connection pooling were taken to optimize resource utilization and application performance.\n\nThis is our groundwork for data management within the application. The knowledge and infrastructure established with Redis will be leveraged in subsequent sprints as we build out application logic and workflows.\n\n## Sprint 5 Preview: Infrastructure and Workflow Automation\n\nMoving into Sprint 5, the focus will shift towards building out the core infrastructure and automating key deployment and operational aspects of the project. The planned objectives include:\n\n1. **Network Infrastructure (NAT Gateways):** Ensuring secure outbound internet access for resources in private subnets.\n2. **Network Security (Security Groups & NACLs):** Implementing granular network access control at both the instance and subnet levels.\n3. **Workflow Automation (Step Functions):** Designing and implementing automated workflows to orchestrate various application tasks, potentially involving Lambda functions.\n4. **Scalability & Resilience (Auto Scaling):** Configuring auto-scaling capabilities for compute resources (Lambdas and potentially EC2/ECS) to ensure application availability and handle varying loads.\n5. **Data Security (KMS Keys):** Implementing encryption at rest using customer-managed KMS keys to protect sensitive data.\n6. **Access Control (IAM Roles & Policies):** Defining and implementing least-privilege IAM roles and policies for various AWS resources to ensure secure access and permissions.\n7. **Credential Management (Secrets Manager):** Fully integrating AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage database credentials and other sensitive information, building upon the initial exploration in Sprint 4.\n8. **VPC Architecture (VPC and Subnet Strategy):** Defining the complete Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture, including CIDR ranges, public/private subnet layout across Availability Zones, and documenting this design.\n\nThe work completed with Redis in Sprint 4, particularly regarding connectivity and credential management, will directly inform the configuration of security groups, NACLs, IAM roles, and the full integration with Secrets Manager planned for Sprint 5. The ability to connect to and interact with our chosen data store is a prerequisite for building the application workflows that will be orchestrated using Step Functions.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"jacobhaseman1+344sqrr28nw81ewsf6n+34fhqkop351kmo22qfr+2eiv2qyuj0@boards.trello.com","externalSource":null,"idBoard":"67f424b7f2cf1ef743101eda","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"67f4258da2904eb696716cbf","idMemberCreator":"67cf41054df51ea848ca63df","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"67f4239417e6cdfb6c2e7471","idShort":107,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Review
